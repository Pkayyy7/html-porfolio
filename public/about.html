<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Originally an actuarial science student, my appreciation of code began, though late, after learning R.
  With a good foundation in math and basic ICT, nurturing my skills in code came naturally and has brought me here today. 
</p>

<p>I am a 24 year old male from the West African country of Ghana, inspired by the advancement of tech and wanting
  to be involved in any way, little or small.</p>

<p>With the goal of becoming a data scientist/analyst, I aim to be knowledgeable and formidable in the broad aspects of coding, statistics and finance.</p>
